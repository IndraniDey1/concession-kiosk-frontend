# concession-kiosk-frontend
Frontend component for the concession kiosk demo app.
This application is forked from Jan Kleinert's github. Thank you Jan.

This application is part of a 3 tier application. Which has a front-end, backe-end and a mongodb database. Perfect for a
typical sample nodejs application. You will find the backend application at 
https://github.com/IndraniDey1/concession-kiosk-backend.git which is also forked from Jan Kienert's github. 

# The entire application ( front-end and back-end) will be used to demonstrate different aspect of openshift deployment.
Following is a list of topic:
-  how Openshift Configmaps or Environment variables can be accessed by nodejs application. Please see app.js file 
-  how to connect the front-end to back-end
